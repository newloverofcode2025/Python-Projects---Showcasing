# QR Code Generator ðŸ“±

A Python-based tool that generates QR codes from text or URLs.

## Features
- Generates QR codes for any text or URL.
- Saves the QR code as an image file (PNG format).
- Customizable file names for the output.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/QRCodeGenerator.git
   cd QRCodeGenerator

   ## Installation

Before running the QR Code Generator, you need to install the required Python libraries.  It's recommended to use a virtual environment to keep your project dependencies isolated.

1. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install qrcode pillow
   ... (after installation and cloning/cd)

3. **Run the QR Code Generator:**
   Execute the script from your terminal. You'll likely need to provide the text or URL you want to encode into a QR code as an argument.  ( *You'll need to elaborate here based on how your script actually works.  Does it take command-line arguments? Does it prompt for input?*)

   **Example (assuming your script takes the text as a command-line argument):**
   ```bash
   python qr_code_generator.py "Hello, QR Code!"
   python qr_code_generator.py "[https://www.example.com](https://www.example.com)"
   python qr_code_generator.py "My QR Code Text" my_qrcode_image.png
